<!--
react and react dom are separate because reacrt is used in lots of other environments like native/iOS/andriod, etc.
reactDOM is required only when you're using react on the net

below div is the container div for our react application. All applications requires some element that exists in our website that they can attach to.

With the type->'text/babel' bable will be able to understand that it should actually do something with the code inside.
if we have ESX features or JSX, bable is gonna convert that automatically for us

for the render function we are gonna pass 2 args, first is a piece of JSX(JavaScript XML) and second is our app element

bundle.js will be created by webpack

<body>
  <div id="app"></div>
  <script src="bundle.js"></script>
