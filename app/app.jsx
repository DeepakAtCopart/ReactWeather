// '?_k=tiviqh' these type of weird characters are used by react router to
//          keep track of the state of our application between route changes
// When we render About component we also want to show Main conponent.

// <Route path="about" component={About}/> this matches /about, which renders about component in the main component
// <Example path="example" component={Example}/> matches /example component in the main component
// If it doesn't match 'about' or 'example', then weather component will be rendered in main component
